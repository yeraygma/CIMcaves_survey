    <h1>Cumulative Impact Model for sea caves in the Canary Islands. version H1</h1>
    <p>Information to fiill on the survey</p>
        
        This survey aims to contribute to an investigation to enhance understanding of human impacts on the biological communities of sea caves, using the Canary Islands as a case study. To achieve this, the vulnerability values of this ecosystem to a range of anthropogenic stressors will be assessed. 
        
        The information collected here consists of subjective ratings by each respondent on 7 vulnerability criteria for each stressor. While the survey is based on expert judgment, responses should consider the state of the art on each topic queried.
        
        The initial web link redirects randomly to one of a set of surveys designed for this purpose, and each respondent can only take the survey once. Prior experience or knowledge of the Canary Islands's marine ecosystems is not essential; in fact, greater diversity in participants' backgrounds is preferred. However, information will be requested regarding participants' familiarity with the biogeographical characteristics of the Canary region.
        
        This survey is grounded in the theoretical framework of cumulative impact models first introduced by Benjamin Halpern and collaborators in 2007 and 2008, and subsequently expanded upon by other authors.
        
        Criteria and their definitions to be evaluated for each stressor are:</p>
        
            Pressure distance. At what distance from the site of the activity will the pressure decrease to an insignificant level?.</p>
            Frequency. How regular are occurrences of discrete threat events?.</p>
            Functional impact. The trophic level where impact operates.</p>
            Resistance. The average tendency to resist changing its “natural” state in response to a threat.</p>
            Recovery time. Time required for restoration to the natural state once the threat has passed.</p>
            Certainty. Confidence in results based on personal experience and/or existing empirical studies.</p>
            Stressor local knowledge. Degree of knowledge about the characteristics and quantification of a given stressor in the Canary Islands.
